Idea from reading eosio-rust source code (no published docs, yet):

1. Instantiate eosio::action::Action.
   
   * Not sure exactly how permissions are set or requested.
   
2. Invoke eosio_cdt::action::send...
   
   * Not sure which send function to use.

For PermissionLevel argument, see action::test_test
